    "# Week 2 Project: Refining the Art of Sentiment Analysis at ModaMetric\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Week 2! The ModaMetric team is still buzzing from the achievements of last week. You've shown them the power of Metaflow and the potential of machine learning. However, there's more to explore, more to refine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, weâ€™ll delve into the [Women's Ecommerce Clothing Reviews Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews), the dataset that helped us unlock valuable insights for ModaMetric. Your mission is to further refine the sentiment analysis process, enabling ModaMetric to better understand the sentiments embedded in the customer reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1: Orchestrating the Dance of Sentiment Analysis Models with Metaflow\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you'll utilize Metaflow to train two sentiment analysis models: the baseline \"majority class\" classifier and your own custom model. The models will be trained simultaneously, flexing the power of Metaflow. Your task also involves tweaking the models' hyperparameters for optimal performance. Finally, you'll analyze the performance of these models using Metaflow's Client API. Here's how you'll proceed:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Constructing the Sentiment Analysis Workflows\n",
    "Your first task is to construct the Metaflow workflows. Begin with the baseline \"majority class\" classifier and then move on to your custom model. Make sure your custom model includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Feel free to use techniques from Week 1 and any other [resources](https://outerbounds.com/docs/nlp-tutorial-L2/) you find useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Parallel Training of Models\n",
    "Having built the models, you'll use Metaflow to train them simultaneously. The race is on - can the custom model outshine the baseline? If you find yourself in a bind, you might find the [FlowSpec branching documentation](https://docs.metaflow.org/metaflow/basics#branch) useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: The Hyperparameters Experiment\n",
    "Once you've trained the models, it's time for some fine-tuning. Experiment with different hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. Record the performance of each model under different hyperparameter combinations as Data Artifacts in Metaflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Results Analysis\n",
    "With the experiments complete, it's time to analyze the results. Use Metaflow's Client API to fetch the data and create visualizations to compare the models' performances. The goal is to identify the best hyperparameters for each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this task, you're not only refining the sentiment analysis process at ModaMetric but also honing your own skills in orchestrating complex machine learning workflows using Metaflow.\n"

    "### Step 1: Forecasting Potential Failure Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to overcoming challenges is to anticipate them. Start by picturing possible failure scenarios from an engineering perspective. For instance, you might think about problems like overfitting to the training data or biases in the data. Remember, the first step to finding a solution is acknowledging the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Strategizing to Mitigate Failure Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Having identified the potential obstacles, your next task is to devise counter-strategies. Consider what steps you'd take to address the problem if it arises. For instance, to counter overfitting, you could employ regularization techniques such as L1 or L2 regularization. Think of this step as drawing up a contingency plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Planning Ahead to Dodge Failure Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond reactive strategies, you also need a proactive plan. What could you have done at the outset to avoid these potential pitfalls? Could you have collected a more diverse dataset to reduce bias? Or experimented with different model architectures? The goal is to minimize reactive measures and maximize foresight.\n",
    "\n",
    "This task emphasizes the importance of anticipation in machine learning projects. By identifying possible failure modes and crafting mitigation strategies, you'll be preparing yourself for a smooth-sailing machine learning journey at ModaMetric.\n"

    "It's time for you to go beyond the code and transform data into a visual narrative. As a member of ModaMetric's data science team, your next mission is to enhance the existing flow in your `baseline_challenge.py` file. Add a new layer that gathers the results from all the hyperparameter tuning jobs. But that's not all - you're also going to breathe life into this aggregated data by creating a data visualization using Metaflow cards. Here's what you need to do:\n",
